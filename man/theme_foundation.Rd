\description{
This theme is designed to be a foundation from which to build new
themes, and not meant to be used directly. \code{theme_foundation}
is a complete theme with only minimal number of elements defined.
}
\details{
It is easier to create new themes by extending this one rather
than \code{theme_gray} or \code{theme_bw}, because those themes
those themes define elements deep in the hierarchy.
