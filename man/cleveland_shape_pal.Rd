\description{
Shape palettes for overlapping and non-overlapping points.
}
\note{
In the \emph{Elements of Graphing Data}, W.S. Cleveland suggests
two shape palettes for scatter plots: one for overlapping data and
another for non-overlapping data. The symbols for overlapping data
relies on pattern discrimination, while the symbols for
non-overlapping data vary the amount of fill. This palatte
attempts to create these palettes. However, I found that these
were hard to replicate. Using the R shapes and unicode fonts: the
symbols can vary in size, they are dependent of the fonts used,
and there does not exist a unicode symbol for a circle with a
vertical line. If someone can improve this palette, please let me
know.

Following Tremmel (1995), I replace the circle with a vertical
line with an encircled plus sign.

\examples{
# overlapping symbol palette
dsamp <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 100), ]
(qplot(carat, price, data=dsamp, shape=cut)
+ theme_bw() + scale_shape_cleveland())
# non-overlapping symbol palette
(qplot(carat, price, data=dsamp, shape=cut)
+ theme_bw() + scale_shape_cleveland(overlap=FALSE))
}
