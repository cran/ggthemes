\description{
Calculate the optimal aspect ratio of a line graph by banking the
slopes to 45 degrees as suggested by W.S. Cleveland. This
maximizes the ability to visually differentiate differences in
slope. This function will calculate the optimal aspect ratio for
a line plot using any of the methods described in Herr and Argwala
(2006). In their review of the methods they suggest using median
absolute slope banking ("ms"), which produces aspect ratios which
are generally the median of the various methods provided here.

\section{Methods}{


As written, all of these methods calculate the aspect ratio (x
/y), but \code{bank_slopes} will return (y / x) to be compatible
with \code{link[ggplot2]{coord_fixed}}.

\strong{Median Absolute Slopes Banking}

Let the aspect ratio be \eqn{\alpha = \frac{w}{h}}{alpha = w / h}
then the median absolute slop banking is the
\eqn{\alpha}{alpha} such that,
\deqn{
  median \left| \frac{s_i}{\alpha} \right| = 1
}{
 median |s_i / alpha|
}

Let \eqn{R_z = z_{max} - z_{min}}{R_z = z_max - z_min} for \eqn{z = x, y},
and \eqn{M = median \| s_i \|}{M = median | s_i |}. Then,
\deqn{
\alpha = M \frac{R_x}{R_y}
}{
alpha = M R_x / R_y
}

\strong{Average-Absolute-Orientation Banking}

This method finds the aspect ratio by setting the average
orientation to 45 degrees. For an aspect ratio
\eqn{\alpha}{alpha}, let the orientation of a line segment be
\eqn{\theta_i(\alpha) = \arctan(s_i / \alpha)}{theta_i(alpha) = atan(s_i / alpha)}.

\deqn{
\frac{ \sum_i \theta_i(\alpha) l_i}{\sum_i l_i} = \frac{\pi}{4} rad
}{
((\sum_i theta_i(alpha) l_i) / (\sum_i l_i)) = (pi / 4 ) rad
}
where \eqn{l_i = 1} if unweighted, and
\eqn{l_i = \sqrt{x_i^2 + y_i^2}}{l_i = sqrt(x_i^2 + y_i^2)}
(length of the line segment), if weighted.
The value of \eqn{\alpha} is found with \code{\link{nlm}}.

\strong{Average Absolute Slope Banking}

Let the aspect ratio be \eqn{\alpha = \frac{w}{h}}{alpha = w/h}.
then the mean absolute slope banking is the
\eqn{\alpha}{alpha} such that,
\deqn{
  mean \left| \frac{s_i}{\alpha} \right| = 1
}{
 mean |s_i / alpha| = 1
}

Let \eqn{R_z = z_{max} - z_{min}} for \eqn{z = x, y},
and \eqn{M = mean \| s_i \|}. Then,
\deqn{
\alpha = M R_x / R_y
}{
alpha = M R_x / R_y
}

\strong{Banking by Optimizing Orientation Resolution}

The angle between line segments i and j is \eqn{r_{i,j} =
\|\theta_i(\alpha) - \theta_j(\alpha)\|}{r_{i,j} = |
theta_i(alpha) - theta_j(alpha)|}, where \eqn{\theta_i(\alpha) =
\arctan(s_i / \alpha)}{theta_i(alpha) = atan(s_i / \alpha)} and
\eqn{s_i} is the slope of line segment i. This function finds the
\eqn{\alpha} that maximizes the sum of the angles between all
pairs of line segments.

\deqn{
  \max_{\alpha} \sum_i \sum_{j: j < 1} r_{i,j}
}{
  max_{alpha} sum_i sum_{j: j < 1} r_{i,j}
}

The local optimization only includes line-segments
that are next to each other. Suppose there are n line
segments, then the local orientation orientation
has the following objective function.

\deqn{
  \max_{\alpha} \sum_{i=2}^{n} r_{i,i-1}
}{
  max_{\alpha} sum_{i=2}^{n} r_{i,i-1}
}
}
\examples{
# Use the classic sunspot data from Cleveland's orig paper
x <- seq_along(sunspot.year)
y <- as.numeric(sunspot.year)
# Without banking
m <- qplot(x, y, geom="line")
m

## Using the default method, Median Absolute Slope
ratio <- bank_slopes(x, y)
m + coord_fixed(ratio = ratio)

## Alternative methods to calculate the banking
bank_slopes(x, y, method="ms")
## Using culling
bank_slopes(x, y, method="ms", cull=TRUE)
## Average Absolute Slope
bank_slopes(x, y, method="as")
bank_slopes(x, y, method="as", cull=TRUE)
## Average Orientation
bank_slopes(x, y, method="ao")
bank_slopes(x, y, method="ao", cull=TRUE)
## Average Orientation (Weighted)
bank_slopes(x, y, method="ao", weight=TRUE)
bank_slopes(x, y, method="ao", cull=TRUE, weight=TRUE)
## Global Orientation Resolution
bank_slopes(x, y, method="gor")
bank_slopes(x, y, method="gor", cull=TRUE)
## Local Orientation Resolution
bank_slopes(x, y, method="lor")
bank_slopes(x, y, method="lor", cull=TRUE)
